 jQuery Selectors and Events

# Overview
For lab-02, we were tasked to retrieve data from a JSON file by using an ajax method. From there, we use the information to upload images to our HTML page to create an image gallery. By clicking a filter keyword, it will display the images that have that specific keyword and hide the rest of the images.
